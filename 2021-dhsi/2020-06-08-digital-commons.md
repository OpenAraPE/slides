##  Aims and principles

1. ideas:
    - unite **available** facsimiles and transcriptions
    - harvest, generate, validate and share open metadata
2. aims
    + **validate** and **improve** the transcription with the facsimiles
    - **train** text and layout recognition algorithms to make the textual heritage accessible to digitisation efforts
    - **citable** for scholars, **linkable** for machines to facilitate use and adoption of the resources
    - **open licences** to facilitate re-use
3. principles
    - use as few as possible **open** and **simple** formats and tools
    - re-use/purpose **available** and **established** tools, technologies, and material
    - use **free-to-use** platforms without lock-in of data

## Why spend the effort? Shouldn't others do it?

OpenArabicPE addresses a clear need, fundamental rights, and our scholarly duties:

1. Societies of the Global South have a **right** to unhampered access to their **own cultural record**---a cultural record that is frequently held by institutions of the Global North---and **on their own terms**
2. The general public and scholarly communities **need** access to an important local and quotidian source to tell and recover local stories
3. Scholarly communities have a duty of care

# Digitisation as the promised solution to all our problems?
## Digitisation != online != accessible
