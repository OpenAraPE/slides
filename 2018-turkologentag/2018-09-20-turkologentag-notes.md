- inspired by the panel abstract and its emphasis on the chances and challenges of *digitisation*
- the purpose of this paper is to scrutinise the state and meaning of *access* to *digitised* Arabic periodicals against the backdrop of our interest in the late Ottoman Arabic ideosphere. Ultimately, I am interested in finding the answers to two questions:
    + Who wrote what and from where?
    + What did they read?
- After evaluating the state of *digitisation*, I will discuss "Open Arabic Periodical Editions", our proposal and project to produce truly *digital* editions---that is machine-actionable editions of the full text with embedded structural and semantic information and in a standardised exchange format.
